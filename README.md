# WunderGraph BFF SDK Archive This repository serves as an archive for the WunderGraph BFF (Backend for Frontend) SDK, its documentation, Go binaries, and related 
assets. ## Purpose The original WunderGraph BFF SDK project has been officially taken down. This repository aims to preserve the codebase, documentation, and other 
essential components for those who may still rely on it or wish to reference it in the future. The project was previously in an archived state before its complete 
removal. ## Contents This archive includes: * The source code for the WunderGraph BFF SDK. * Associated documentation as it existed before the takedown. * 
Pre-compiled Go binaries (if available). * Any other relevant configuration files or examples. ## Disclaimer
